### About ###

[Simple Features WKB](http://ngageoint.github.io/simple-features-wkb-ios/) is an iOS Objective-C library for writing and reading [Simple Feature](https://github.com/ngageoint/simple-features-ios) Geometries to and from Well-Known Binary.

### Usage ###

#### Read ####

```objectivec

//NSData *bytes = ...    

SFByteReader *reader = [[SFByteReader alloc] initWithData:bytes];
[reader setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];
SFGeometry *geometry = [SFWGeometryReader readGeometryWithReader:reader];
enum SFGeometryType geometryType = geometry.geometryType;

```

#### Write ####

```objectivec

//SFGeometry *geometry = ...

SFByteWriter *writer = [[SFByteWriter alloc] init];
[writer setByteOrder:CFByteOrderBigEndian];
[SFWGeometryWriter writeGeometry:geometry withWriter:writer];
NSData *bytes = [writer getData];
[writer close];

```

#### Read ####

```swift

// var data: Data = ...

let reader: SFByteReader = SFByteReader(data: data);
reader.byteOrder = Int(CFByteOrderBigEndian.rawValue);
let geometry: SFGeometry = SFWGeometryReader.readGeometry(with:reader);
let geometryType: SFGeometryType = geometry.geometryType;

```

#### Write ####

```swift

//let geometry: SFGeometry = ...

let writer: SFByteWriter = SFByteWriter();
writer.byteOrder = Int(CFByteOrderBigEndian.rawValue);
SFWGeometryWriter.write(geometry, with: writer);
let data: Data = writer.getData();
writer.close();

```
